# Overview
Mcblend is a Blender plugin designed for Minecraft creators. It enables users to create and modify Minecraft Bedrock Edition models within the Blender interface. With Mcblend, creators can use Blender's tools to design and texture new models for Minecraft, or bring existing models into Blender for further editing. Mcblend is a useful tool for anyone looking to use Blender's powerful 3D modeling and animation tools to enhance their Minecraft creations.

## Features
- Exporting and importing models for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, including support for polymesh and cube-based models of attachables and entities.
- Exporting keyframe animations and poses for entities and attachables, and baking animations into Minecraft format, including support for using inverse kinematics and constraints to create complex movements.
- Generating UV maps and textures for Minecraft models.
- Access to Blender features such as physics simulation and rigging for animating Minecraft models, and a function for automatic rigid body setup for a model.

## Planned features
Some of the planned features for the Mcblend project can be found in the ["Issues"](https://github.com/Nusiq/mcblend/issues) tab of the GitHub repository.
The page is open for suggestions and feature requests.
