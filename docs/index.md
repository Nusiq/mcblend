# Overview
Mcblend is a Blender addon for creating and animating Minecraft Bedrock Edition models.

## Features
- Importing and exporting Minecraft Bedrock Edition polymesh and cube-based models
  (directly and based on attachables/entities from resource packs).
- Exporting keyframe animations and poses for entities and attachables.
- Animations can be baked into Minecraft format even if they use features
  not supported by the game like inverse kinematics and constraints.
- Generating UV-maps and textures for Minecraft models.
- Simplified process of creating physics simulations based on the rigid bodies.

## Planned features
The improvements planned for this Blender plugin are often listed as
["issues"](https://github.com/Nusiq/mcblend/issues) on the GitHub project page.
The page is open for suggestions and feature requests.
