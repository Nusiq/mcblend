# Matching framerate
By default, Blender uses 24FPS framerate. Minecraft uses seconds to define
the timestamps of keyframes in animation. It's good to change the framerate setting
into something that divides 1 second period into something nice - for example
(25FPS or 20FPS). 1/24 is 0.0416666 but 1/25 is 0.04 which looks neater in the
animation file.

You can find the framerate setting in `Output Properties -> Frame Rate`.
