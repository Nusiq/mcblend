# Overview

The GUI section of the documentation for the Mcblend plugin provides a list and explanation of all additional graphical user interface elements added by the plugin. This section serves as a reference, providing information on the various GUI elements added to Blender by Mcblend. It is not meant to be a comprehensive guide on how to use the plugin, but rather a resource to refer to while working through user guides and tutorials to understand the buttons, tabs, and other GUI elements relevant to the tasks being performed.
