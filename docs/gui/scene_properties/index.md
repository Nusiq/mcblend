# GUI - Scene properties

The Scene properties tab has two new panels:

- **Mcblend: UV-groups** - used for [creating](/mcblend/uv_groups) and [customizing](/mcblend/texture_customization) UV-groups.
- **Mcblend: Animation Events** - used for adding events for creating [sound and particle effects animations](/mcblend/animating_effects).

The functionality of both panels is described in separate sections.
