# Installation and updating

## Installation
1. Download and install
  [Blender 3.3](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-3/) (the current LTS version).
2. Download the "latest" or "pre-release" version (zip file) from the project
  page on GitHub: [https://github.com/Nusiq/mcblend/releases](https://github.com/Nusiq/mcblend/releases)

```{note}
Mcblend project uses *pre-release* for versions which aren't fully
documented. The are stable and ready to use. It's recommended to use the
*pre-release* version because it may contain some bug fixes and in most
cases the only downside is that you might see some unexplained buttons
here and there.

Sometimes there is no *pre-release* version available. This means that the
project is fully documented and you should download the *latest* version.
```

3. In Blender go to: `Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install...`

## Updating
Currently there is no system for updating Mcblend. If you want to update it, you
must uninstall the old version of the addon and then install the new one.
