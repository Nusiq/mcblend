# Installation and updating

## Installation

2. Download the latest version of Mcblend from the project page on GitHub: [https://github.com/Nusiq/mcblend/releases](https://github.com/Nusiq/mcblend/releases).

  If a pre-release version is available, it may include additional features and bug fixes. The pre-release versions are stable but not yet fully documented. The user interface may also differ from the version described in the documentation.
  ```
