This module is based on: `fake_bpy_modules_4.1-20240604.zip` from the Fake Bpy Module project. The original project can be found at:
https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module/releases/tag/20240604


This module is used to provide type checking for Blender's bpy and mathutils module in the Mcblend project. The default fake-bpy-module was insufficient for Mcblend because of its inacuracies and lack of types that are specific to Mcblend.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is not useful for developing other Blender addons. If you're looking for a fake bpy module, please use the original project instead or create your own fork if your project requires additional types.
